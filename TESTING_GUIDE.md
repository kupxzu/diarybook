## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### Like button not instant?
**Check:** 
- `toggleLikeOptimistic` is dispatched first
- Redux state updates immediately
- Server sync happens in background

### Comments not toggling?
**Check:**
- `expandedComments` state in Redux
- `handleToggleComments` function
- Using `expandedComments[diary.id]` not `showComments`

### Post creation not working?
**Check:**
- `createNewDiary` thunk is defined
- API endpoint exists
- Message is not empty

### Redux DevTools not working?
**Install:**
```bash
# Chrome/Edge
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/

# Firefox
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/
```
